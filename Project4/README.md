# SwiftBrowser

in this project we built on our new knowledge of UIBarButtonItem, UIAlertController and NSURL by producing a simple web browser app in Swift.

This project covered WKWebView , UIToolbar , UIProgessView, delegation, classes and structs, key-value observing, and how to create views in code
