# Whack-a-Penguin

It was time for another game, and we used more of SpriteKit to build a whack-a-mole-style game, except with penguins because Whack-a-Penguin isn't trademarked. We learned about SKCropNode, SKTexture and some more types of SKAction, and we also used dispatch_after() to execute closures after a delay.
